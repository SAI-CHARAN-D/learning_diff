# Learning Diff Bharat - Requirements

## 1. The Problem

Indian students and developers struggle to understand how well they truly grasp technical concepts over time. Traditional learning methods provide only snapshot assessments that miss evolving misconceptions and don't track conceptual understanding progression.

Key issues:
- Students believe they understand topics after initial exposure, but comprehension degrades over time
- No systematic way to track conceptual understanding evolution
- Misconceptions go undetected and become ingrained learning obstacles

## 2. The User

Anyone across India learning technical concepts who wants to build deep understanding:
- Students, professionals, self-learners of any background or experience level
- Learning topics like algorithms, data structures, programming, or any technical subject
- Need deep, lasting understanding rather than surface-level familiarity
- Want to identify and correct misconceptions before they become obstacles

## 3. The AI Edge

AI enables continuous monitoring of conceptual understanding that humans cannot scale:
- Natural language processing analyzes user explanations for clarity and accuracy
- Pattern recognition detects subtle misconceptions in problem-solving approaches
- Machine learning tracks understanding evolution over weeks and months
- Identifies true mastery versus temporary memorization

## 4. The Success Metric

Success means:
- Learners can clearly see their conceptual understanding evolve over time
- Users catch misconceptions early before they become ingrained
- Learners gain confidence in their knowledge depth and can explain technical concepts with clarity
- The AI becomes a trusted learning companion that helps build genuine mastery rather than superficial familiarity

## 5. The Features

- **Concept Understanding Tracker**: AI analyzes user explanations through text/voice input, tracking clarity, accuracy, and depth over multiple sessions
- **Misconception Detection Engine**: ML models identify common and subtle misconceptions, flagging incomplete or incorrect understanding
- **Targeted Feedback System**: Personalized recommendations addressing specific gaps, with follow-up questions to verify mastery and track improvement
